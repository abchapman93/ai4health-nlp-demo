    "# Overview\n",
    "In the last notebook, we used rule-based matching to extract mentions of treatments and problems from patient texts. One disadvantage of rule-based systems is that it can take a long time to manually curate all of the rules, particularly if the classes you're extracting are very broad and have many variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is **statistical NLP**. In this approach, we **annotate** a large corpus of text to identify the concepts we're interested in. Then we use those annotations as examples to train a machine learning model. In the machine learning module, we used ML to predict binary outcomes (0 or 1) for whether patients have conditions. In NER, a machine learning model predicts a label for each word in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## i2b2\n",
    "The NLP community hosts many **shared tasks**. These are competitions where multiple teams are given the same data and instructions and build different systems. These datasets include **gold standard annotations**, which are large sets of annotated examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a statistical model, I used data from the i2b2 2012 shared task: [**\"Evaluating temporal relations in clinical text\"**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756273/). This model was trained on data for the first subtask in the shared task, referred to in the challenge as **\"Clinically relevant events\"**. For the purpose of this module, I specifically restricted it to the following labels of **clinical concepts**:\n",
    "- **Problems:** Diagnoses, signs, and symptoms\n",
    "- **Tests:** Lab and vital measurements\n",
    "- **Treatments:** Medications, procedures, and therapies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in seeing how to train this model, see this notebook: [./appendix-train-i2b2-ner.ipynb](./appendix-train-i2b2-ner.ipynb). If you would like get access to the data for the challenge so you can actually train the model yourself, fill out this data access form on the i2b2 website: https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/. Once you're approved, you can download the XML files and change the path variables in the notebook to read in the original data sources.\n",

I named this model **\"en_info_3700_i2b2_2012\"**. The **\"en\"** stands for **\"English\"** (every spaCy model needs to start with its language), and the rest is named after the class and shared task."
